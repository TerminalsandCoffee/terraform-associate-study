3. **Quiz** yourself by summarizing the topic or teaching it to someone else before moving on.

## Contribute
- Add new content inside the appropriate domain folder, following the existing structure.
- Keep hands-on tasks short (a few commands or a concise Terraform snippet) so learners can complete them quickly.
- Update this README when adding new top-level domains or reorganizing content.
- Open issues or pull requests with clear descriptions of what changed and why.

Happy studying, and good luck on the Terraform Associate exam!
