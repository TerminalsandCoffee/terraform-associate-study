# 01 - State Management

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what Terraform state is and why it’s critical.
- Learn how to configure **remote state** storage using AWS S3 and DynamoDB.
- Explore best practices for securing and managing state files.
- Understand **state locking**, **migration**, and **drift detection**.

---

## 🧩 1. What Is Terraform State?

Terraform is declarative — it describes *desired infrastructure*.  
To track what’s already deployed, it maintains a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`).

The state file:
- Maps Terraform resources → real-world infrastructure (IDs, ARNs, IPs)
- Stores attributes, dependencies, and metadata
- Enables drift detection during `terraform plan`

Without it, Terraform wouldn’t know what exists and could recreate resources unnecessarily.

**Analogy:**  
Terraform state = Terraform’s “memory” or “etcd” (like Kubernetes).  
Lose it, and Terraform forgets your infrastructure.

## 🗂️ 2. Local vs Remote State

### Local State
- Default behavior (file saved in your working directory)
- Fine for single-user testing
- Risks: lost state, drift, no collaboration, secrets exposure

### Remote State
- Stored in a shared backend (AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
- Enables team collaboration
- Secures access, adds locking, and provides durability

---

## ☁️ 3. Using AWS for Remote State

### Step 1: Create an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-terraform-state-bucket --region us-east-1

aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name terraform-locks \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
  --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST
```

### Step 2: Configure the backend
```bash
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "dev/network/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
Then run: 
```
terraform init
```
Terraform will ask to migrate local state → remote backend.

## 4. State Locking

To prevent two people running terraform apply simultaneously:

- DynamoDB table enables state locking.
- Terraform automatically locks before changes and releases after.
- If locked, you’ll see:

```
Error acquiring state lock
```

## 5. Security & Best Practices

| Practice                               | Purpose                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Encrypt state in S3 (`encrypt = true`) | Protect secrets in transit and at rest         |
| Restrict IAM access                    | Only admins/CI should access the state bucket  |
| Enable S3 versioning                   | Recover corrupted or deleted state             |
| Use `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rule   | Avoid accidental destruction of critical infra |
| Never commit `.tfstate` files          | They may contain secrets                       |

Optional KMS encryption:
```
kms_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-..."
```

## 6.Important Commands

| Command                          | Description                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform state list`           | Lists all resources tracked in state              |
| `terraform state show <addr>`    | Shows attributes of a specific resource           |
| `terraform state mv <old> <new>` | Moves or renames resources inside state           |
| `terraform state rm <addr>`      | Removes a resource from state without deleting it |
| `terraform state pull`           | Retrieves current state (useful for debugging)    |

---

## 7. Real-World Example

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-study-state"
    key            = "labs/webserver/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "state-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "StateExample"
  }
}

output "web_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}

```

## 8. Key Takeaways
- State = Terraform’s source of truth for infrastructure.
- Remote state (S3 + DynamoDB) enables collaboration, durability, and locking.
- Always secure state (encryption + IAM).
- Never modify terraform.tfstate manually — use terraform state commands.
- Think of the state file as Terraform’s equivalent of etcd in Kubernetes.

---

## 9. Lab Challenge
Create a remote state backend using:
1. S3 bucket (my-terraform-lab-state)
2. DynamoDB table (terraform-lock-lab)
3. A simple EC2 instance
4. Verify remote state exists with aws s3 ls
5. Try intentionally applying twice to test locking
