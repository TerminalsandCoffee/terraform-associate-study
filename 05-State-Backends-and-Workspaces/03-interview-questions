# SECTION 10 — Senior-Level Terraform Interview Questions 💪  
*(The ones that separate the pros from the juniors)*

Practice these like it’s the real interview — try answering out loud before you peek! 👀

### 1. Why does Terraform need state?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer (don’t peek too early!)</summary>

To keep a real-time mapping between your config and actual cloud resources so it knows exactly what changed and what to create/update/delete during `plan`/`apply`.

</details>

### 2. How do you fix infrastructure drift?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer</summary>

Run `terraform plan` to detect it, then either `apply` to enforce the desired state **or** update your code to match reality (and optionally `terraform refresh` / `refresh-only`).

</details>

### 3. What is the benefit of a remote backend?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer</summary>

Centralized state storage, state-file versioning, and most importantly — **state locking** so two people don’t corrupt state at the same time.

</details>

### 4. What happens if someone deletes a resource manually in AWS?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer</summary>

Terraform sees it’s missing during the next `plan` and will happily recreate it on `apply` (because desired state > reality).

</details>

### 5. How do you import an existing S3 bucket?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer</summary>

Write the `aws_s3_bucket` resource block first, then run:  
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-name"
}
```
```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.demo my-bucket-name
```

Remember: Import moves real world → state file. It does NOT generate or fix your config!
</details>

### 6. What is state locking?
<details>
<summary>🔍 Show Answer</summary>

A safety mechanism (usually handled by the remote backend) that prevents multiple Terraform runs from modifying the state file simultaneously and causing corruption.
